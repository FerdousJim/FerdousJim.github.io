                    <p class="content">
                        Blockchain is now one of the most emerging fields in the computer science technology for data storage and transaction on online data among researchers and academics for the recent years. Hence, Blockchain implemnetation on exam result storage database is demandable field to work on. Aim of this thesis is to create a web application to store exam results data using blockchain that can perform to store data by an owner who have the authority to input the data and the other users would only view the data usng their hash id. Here, I have used an Ethereum smart contract which is written by solidity programming language to create a contract that perform or execute the code based on some given conditions. I have used ganache framework for testing and debugging and development purpose of the smart contract. I have used the web3.js library which is the official Ethereum Javascript API. It is used to interact with Ethereum smart contracts and some html and CSS codes for designing purpose. In this thesis I have successfully create a web application. And in the backend part it stores data using the blockchain cryptography. As in recent we are more concerned about securing our data storage because of tampering issues. Exam result tampering is nowadays a common problem in our country and so blockchain implementation in exam result storage database is a noteworthy task. Therefore, our study has highlighted the research studies in the field of decentralized and distributed ledger in exam results database
