                        sense, how can I put it? it travels. No not only in the brain. It travels through the whole body. <br>
                        How can it be implemented in a machine?<br>
                        A machine can perform the task that a human can do but how can you implement the sense that humans possess.<br>
                         Traditional if-else can not replace the work of sensitivity. people evolve because of sensitivity. the brain with its neural connection gets fired up because of sensitivity.

                    <p class="contentt">The problem with getting what you wanted is that you start realizing that your unhappiness does not stem from something tangible. The realization takes you by surprise, you start your life with a certain number of guesses of what will make you happy and you slowly give up trying.<br>
                        <br>
                        Some people are capable of accepting this fact and live their life in oblivious. I have tried and failed, like a pendulum I have gone from trying to live in the moment and tying up my happiness with something big that can still be achieved.
                        <br>
                        And, I honestly do not know how long I can continue doing this.

                    <p class="contentt">You keep looking at the knife in your hand, keep thinking about the opportunity cost. You decide to do something and you bear the cost. You hurt yourself to prove you are hurting and bear the cost of hurting people who actually care. You prove to him that you are not crazy and that all the sleepless nights you are having are not an overreaction, by doing something crazier. How does that work? It does not make sense but you want him to take you seriously, your emotions seriously. You want him to notice, to care, to make you feel like he cares. Is that too much too ask?<br>
                        <br>
                        You feel the headache steeping in your skull like a tea bag in a hot cup of water, you can feel the colors in your brain, the melancholy through your veins. You feel the pain take over, the physical pain is something you'd much rather tolerate. You darken your room, turn on the music and lie down on the floor. You try not to be too familiar with this sadness, but you fail, like every other night. You cry, why is your tears hot, didn't you hear that means you are going to hell? As if anything can be worse than how your heart feels at the moment.<br>
                        <br>                        
                        ......<br>
                        
                        You wake up thirsty and covered in sweat. Your head hurts as you struggle to drag your body off the floor. Your back hurts from sleeping on the floor, you are getting old. You get up to get water and you notice it for the first time. The knife, with blood, you feel dizzy. You take a look at your hand, you are fine. Then where did the blood come from?

                    <p class="contentt">Tim: “Do you ever make a situation worse because you feel like you'd handle it better?”<br>
                        Becca: “What do you mean by that?”<br>
                        Tim: “Like you are having a normal argument and you feel like you need to break the relationship because you know how to handle that but you don't know how to confront it. You are used to being called the bitch and stone-hearted, you know how to survive alone.”<br>
                        ...<br>
                        Tim: “Did you take a walk outside today?”<br>
                        Becca: “No, I did not feel like it and honestly I am tired of your stupid advice and pretentious comments. You are not a psychologist you know.”
                        Tim: “I know, I am just trying you help you understand yourself better. I don't pretend to know you, all my advice is generic, applicable for all.”
                        Becca: “I need to go”<br>
                        <br>
                        Becca storms out of the trailer, and slams the door so hard she hurts her wrist a bit, she curses at the door. She hates this town, the weather is always the opposite of what she wants. She wanted a gloomy day but it is sunny like hell. She wanted a sad day, a day for herself where she can sulk. Suddenly, a dead squirrel falls before her, she gets scared and moves back and hits the trailer with her back.<br>
                        <br>
                        She did not know but her wish got accepted, a wish for a gloomy day for this will be the gloomiest day in her life. As she stands there shocked at what just happened, she starts to hear the noise of things falling from the sky but she does not know what. She tries to go near the sound behind the trailer and notices thousands of animals, and birds falling from the sky, all dead.
