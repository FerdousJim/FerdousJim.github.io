                    <p class="content">
                        Blockchain is now one of the most emerging fields in the computer science technology for data storage and transaction on online data among researchers and academics for the recent years. Hence, Blockchain implemnetation on exam result storage database is demandable field to work on. Aim of this thesis is to create a web application to store exam results data using blockchain that can perform to store data by an owner who have the authority to input the data and the other users would only view the data usng their hash id. Here, I have used an Ethereum smart contract which is written by solidity programming language to create a contract that perform or execute the code based on some given conditions. I have used ganache framework for testing and debugging and development purpose of the smart contract. I have used the web3.js library which is the official Ethereum Javascript API. It is used to interact with Ethereum smart contracts and some html and CSS codes for designing purpose. In this thesis I have successfully create a web application. And in the backend part it stores data using the blockchain cryptography. As in recent we are more concerned about securing our data storage because of tampering issues. Exam result tampering is nowadays a common problem in our country and so blockchain implementation in exam result storage database is a noteworthy task. Therefore, our study has highlighted the research studies in the field of decentralized and distributed ledger in exam results database

                        The car is mainly built using arduino patform. It can be controlled using bluetooh and an android app. the car can be moved with the app and I also placed a robotic hand on top of the car. The car can collect garbage using the robotic hand. the placement and properly building of the robotic hand was a strenuous task.I have to rebuild it several times with precision.

                    <h3>Book Recommender System(Machine Learning)</h3>
                    <p class="content">
                        As I was struggling to search books of my interest based on what i have read so far, I took an initiative to make a machine learning book recommender system website, This is a project on machine learning. I have used three datasets in this project. these are books, users who read books, and ratings by the user. NumPy and pandas are two libraries that I have used. At first, I created a list of 50 popular books according to users' ratings. then I used some collaborative filtering methods to make the website recommend books on user's preference. the steps that I took to make the project are:<br>
                        1.Deleted duplicated data and missing values from my datasets.<br>
                        2.merged ratings and books datasets based on ISBN<br>
                        3.calculated the average rating on each book<br>
                        4.deleted unuseful columns<br>
                        5.created a table based on users id's from books and ratings and user's datasets<br>
                        6.selected top users ids who have at least rated 200 votes<br>
                        7.counted book rating on the basis of the book title<br>
                        8.calculated distances using vectorization <br>
                        9.used similarity matrix<br>
                        10 .finally sorted the book title lists using similarity scores from each particular book.

                        <p class="content">
                            This is my second project on machine learning focusing on recommendation
                            I have collected two datasets for this project. these are the movies dataset and credits dataset. the libraries that i have used are NumPy, pandas, ast, sklearn, and nltk.<br>
                            At first, I have done data preprocessing(missing duplicates and missing values from the two datasets). then I merged the datasets. From the merged dataset I have cleared out unwanted columns. After that, I used an algorithm to make a list of keywords from a string list of keywords. then I have made tags concatenating all the columns for every movie. Then I have done text vectorization. the technique I have used for text vectorization is called bag of words. I calculated cosine similarity for every vector with others. I didn't use euclidean distance because it is not good for large dimensional vectors. Then I did reverse sorting similarities in each movie to others.<br>
                            finally, I fetched out the top 5 similar movies for every movie

                        <h3>Human Posture Detection</h3>
                        <p class="content">
                            This is a simple deep learning project. the model that I have used to build the project is called PoseNet which is developed by the google team. PoseNet is a neural network technique. this model is mostly used in Snapchat filters, some human posture-based gaming software, and other software related to human posture. I have javascript as a language for this project. it is more convenient than python for real-time browser-based projects. the libraries that I have used are ml5.js and p5.js. the functions in p5.js allow us the uses that we can do using the Arduino platform. the book that helped me learn about p5.js is "make: getting started with p5.js". Another library ml.js is also a very useful library nowadays. It aims to make machine learning approachable for a broad audience of artists, creative coders, and students. The library provides access to machine learning algorithms and models in the browser, building tensorflow.js with no other external dependencies. In this project my first, I have detected 17 key points of a human. key points are basically the coordinates. then I have drawn a line between the coordinates to form a skeleton.

                            In this project, I have used a with mask dataset and a without mask dataset. The libraries that I have used for this project are os,cv2, random,NumPy, and sklearn.<br>
                            From sklearn, I have used keras.preprocessing for the training of my two datasets. Then I separated the trainable data from the datasets. Then from my training data, I have checked their accuracy. after that, I have run a function that captures video in real-time and it tells whether the human has a mask or not.
