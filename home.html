                            Hi! I am a recent graduate from the Department of Computer Science at Daffodil International University. I am the owner of an academic school named Janani FHB kinder Garten where I teach students Information and communication technology<br>
<br>
Before teaching, I was a research assistant where I worked on methods for using blockchain technology in various fields of computer science. I did several projects in my undergraduate years and gain hands on experience in different computer related advances.<br>
<br>

I am now passionate about the insights of Artificial Intelligence and love teaching and working with emerging computer techs. Here is the link to my <a href="MyCV.pdf" target="_blank"><button>CV</button></a>
