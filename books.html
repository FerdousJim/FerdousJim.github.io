At first, there were no problems that occur but soon after that the leader got them in conflicting decision making and napoleon got in control of the whole farm by chasing snowball off the farm. later to that the previous owner of the farm returned with his man but failed to do so. Napoleon, now the leader of the farm planned to make a windmill(to make electricity and food storage) which was actually an idea of snowball but he persuade every member of the farm and falsely claimed that this was his(napoleon's) idea, and snowball opposed that.

Napoleon could alter the commandments as he liked and if anyone raised any questions he had met the consequences. Eventually, the pigs begin walking on their hind legs and take on many other qualities of their former human oppressors. The Seven Commandments are reduced to a single law: "All Animals Are Equal / But Some Are More Equal Than Others." The novel ends with Pilkington sharing drinks with the pigs in Jones' house. Napoleon changes the name of the farm back to Manor Farm and quarrels with Pilkington during a card game in which both of them try to play the ace of spades.

Wickham admitted his past with Elizabeth about his growing up with darcy and he also admits that he is very fond of darcy's father, who is a very generous man to allow him to live in Wickham with their family. Wickham claims that Darcy disobeyed his father's bequest of a clergyman's revenue to Wickham out of selfish resentment. Wickham's tale makes Darcy appear not only proud but cruel, and Elizabeth accepts Wickham's account without question, disliking Darcy even more because of it. Amid Jane and Elizabeth's developing relationships, the Bennet family is visited by Mr. Bennet's cousin, William Collins, a clergyman who will inherit Mr. Bennet's estate when he dies because of a legal stricture known as an entail. Full of apologies for the entail and praises for his patroness, Lady Catherine De Bourgh, Mr. Collins informs Mrs. Bennet that Lady Catherine has instructed him to marry and that he plans to choose a wife from the Bennet daughters. He settles on Elizabeth but is stunned and offended when she refuses him. He quickly turns his attention to Elizabeth's friend, Charlotte Lucas, who wants to marry for security rather than love, and the two are soon engaged and married. At the same time, Jane is dismayed to find out that Bingley and the entire Netherfield party have unexpectedly left for London. Caroline Bingley writes to Jane that they do not intend to return, and she predicts a match between Bingley and Darcy's sister, Georgiana, who is also in London. Although Jane quietly resigns herself to a life without Bingley, Elizabeth is angry for her sister and suspects that Bingley's sisters and Darcy are trying to keep him from Jane. Elizabeth visits Charlotte at her new home in Hunsford, Kent, and meets Mr. Collins' patroness and Darcy's aunt, Lady Catherine De Bourgh, an overbearing woman who thrives on meddling in other people's lives. Soon after Elizabeth's arrival in Kent, Darcy visits his aunt with his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam. Darcy puzzles Elizabeth with his behavior; he seems to seek out her company, but he never says much. One day, he surprises Elizabeth by proposing to her. Still repelled by his pride and believing Darcy is responsible for Bingley's separation from Jane and for Wickham's misfortune, Elizabeth refuses him. The next day, Darcy gives her a letter explaining his role in influencing Bingley away from jane and details the facts of Wickham's situation. A careful examination of the facts reveals that Darcy, while proud, is innocent of wrongdoing, leaving Elizabeth mortified at her discovery of how her own pride prejudiced her against Darcy. After returning home for a month, Elizabeth goes on a trip with her aunt and uncle Gardiner to Derbyshire county, where they visit Darcy's estate of Pemberley. There they meet Darcy unexpectedly and are all surprised at how graciously he treats them. He calls on Elizabeth at her inn, introduces her to his sister, and invites her to Pemberley for dinner. Darcy is still in love with Elizabeth, and Elizabeth begins to have similar feelings for him. In the midst of this promising situation, Elizabeth receives two letters from Jane telling her that Lydia has eloped with Wickham, causing Elizabeth and the Gardiners to leave for home immediately. Elizabeth fears that Lydia and the Bennet family are permanently disgraced and that her newly-discovered love for Darcy is hopeless. When Lydia is found, however, she and Wickham marry. After the wedding, Elizabeth discovers that Darcy was instrumental in orchestrating the marriage, thereby saving the reputation and marriageability of the other Bennet daughters. Bingley returns to Netherfield and soon asks Jane to marry him. Jane, of course, accepts, and Mrs. Bennet's exultation is only lessened by her irritation at Darcy's occasional presence. Meanwhile, Elizabeth's happiness for her sister is interrupted by a visit from Lady Catherine De Bourgh, who has heard a rumor that Darcy and Elizabeth are engaged, which they are not. She lectures Elizabeth on the imprudence of such a match, and then demands that Elizabeth promise not to accept any proposal from Darcy. Elizabeth refuses, causing Lady Catherine to tell Darcy about Elizabeth's impertinence and to scold him about the folly of an engagement between them. Lady Catherine's description of Elizabeth's response to her demands gives Darcy hope that Elizabeth has had a change of heart. He proposes again and Elizabeth happily accepts.

                    <p class="content">
                       The novel begins when Robert Langdon is summoned to a Smithsonian fundraiser in Washington DC by his mentor, Peter Solomon, who he is told will be speaking at the event. Robert is told by Peter to bring a small sealed box that he entrusted to Robert years before. Robert arrives at the fundraiser but Peter is not in attendance – after calling Peter's assistant, Robert discovers that the call was a hoax to lure him to the museum by Peter's kidnapper, Mal'akh. Moments later, Robert hears a scream and discovers Peter's severed hand in the Capitol Rotunda. The hand has a Freemason's ring on one finger and is tattooed with mysterious symbols on the fingers and the palm. Robert then meets officers Anderson and Sato, who enlists him to help them interpret the symbols on Peter's hand. The three soon find themselves at a Masonic altar in the Capitol's basement, where they find an inscribed pyramid without its capstone. Anderson and Sato attempt to take Robert into custody because x-ray records show that he was carrying a pyramid-shaped object into the Capitol earlier that evening – this pyramid was in the sealed package that Peter requested Robert bring. But before he can be arrested, the Capitol's architect William Bellamy is added into the mix, and in the confusion, William and Robert flee together. Later, William tells Robert that he wants his assistance in rescuing Peter. At this point, Brown reveals that Mal'akh is a heavily tattooed Freemason, and many chapters are dedicated to telling the backstory between Peter Solomon and Mal'akh. Mal'akh, formerly known as Andros Dareios, was the cellmate of Peter's rebellious son Zachary during his brief imprisonment in Turkey, where Zachary was caught smuggling drugs. Zachary was murdered in prison, and Dareios steals Zachary's large inheritance and flees to Greece. Andros becomes obsessed with the Freemasons from stories Zachary told him in prison and breaks into Peter's house to find the pyramid hidden there. During the break-in, Andros accidentally kills Peter's mother and is then shot by Peter and left to die. He nurses himself back to health takes the name Mal'akh and makes it his mission to uncover the secrets of the Freemasons. For many chapters, there is confusion around the identity of Mal'akh, and William accuses Agent Sato of working with Mal'akh, though she is not. The group is joined by Katherine Solomon, Peter's sister, who runs a noetic science lab at the Smithsonian. Mal'akh destroys her lab and nearly captures her, but she escapes and continues with Robert, William, and Sato in the search to find Peter. Eventually, the group is captured by Mal'akh, and Robert is nearly drowned in a sensory deprivation tank that Mal'akh uses as a tool to interrogate him about the encoded inscription on the bottom of the pyramid capstone. Mal'akh also nearly kills Katherine with a hypodermic needle, and Peter Solomon is discovered alive but weak and bound to a wheelchair. Mal'akh flees with Peter to the Temple Room of the Scottish Rites House of the Temple, and in a shocking reveal the group discovers, at the moment just before Peter kills Mal'akh, that Mal'akh is in fact, Zachary. Rather than being murdered in prison, Zachary had killed another man and disfigured him beyond recognition, and then assumed another identity to escape. Peter tries to kill Zachary, but can't bring himself to do it. At that moment, Sato arrives by helicopter at the Temple and breaks the glass ceiling – the shards of glass fall, and one fatally impales Zachary. At the end of the novel, Peter shows Robert the true secrets of the Freemasons – a Bible, which the Masons believe holds the key to the enlightenment of the human spirit. It is also revealed that Katherine's research has been backed up externally, and as such, she can continue her research.
